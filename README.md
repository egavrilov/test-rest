# test-rest
Endpoint written on node to test REST requests with CORS (AJAX, Fetch API)

If you need an endpoint to test your client requests, you can use `test.huncode.com` (working both at `http` and `https`):

GET, response with status 200: `https://test.huncode.com/get`
GET, response with status 401: `https://test.huncode.com/get/401`
GET, response with status 500: `https://test.huncode.com/get/500`

POST, response with status 200: `https://test.huncode.com/post`
POST, response with status 400: `https://test.huncode.com/post/400`
POST, response with status 500: `https://test.huncode.com/post/500`
